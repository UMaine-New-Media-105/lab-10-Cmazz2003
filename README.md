For lab #10, we were instructed to create our version of a frogger like game. I started by making a class for the lines of my highway so I could make it easier to incorporate their variables later on. I then made a class for my car sprites and I made it so they bounce off the walls of the lanes. Their speeds and colors are also randomized. I then made a class for my sprite that was going to cross the road which ended up just being an ellipse. The sprite can cross the lanes and move about with the arrow keys. https://editor.p5js.org/CMazz/sketches/3IatUoJWm
